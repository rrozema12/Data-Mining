#Log
This is a log of each step I took to complete the final project.

##Data Cleaning
 - Cut the dataset down significantly; more specifically I cut it down to 7500.  
   It was much bigger before, around 50,000. I cut it down to minimize time on
   the running of my program.  I believe that 7500 was small enough to be
   efficient but also large enough to capture the values of the whole dataset.
 - I began cleaning the dataset by hand. If there were any missing values
   in the data set then they were previously identified as a "?". I changed
   this because the scripts that we wrote in class were built to take care
   of missing values labeled with "NA".
 - I used my data cleaning script to remove the instances that contained an NA.
   I do this because I need my scripts to be able to run without errors, and
   missing (NA) values will cause me lots of problems.
 - Changed the values of some of the instances so that it is easier for someone
   who is viewing the table can easily understand what is going on in the
   dataset.
 - I eliminated some attributes because I felt like they were not as important
   to the dataset.

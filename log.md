#Log
This is a log of each step I took to complete the final project.

##Data Cleaning
 - Started cleaning (by hand) the dataset. If there is any missing values
   in the data set then it was previously identified as a "?". I changed 
   this because the algorithms that we made in class were used built to 
   take care of missing values with NAs.
 - Cut the dataset down significatly, to 7500.  It was much bigger before
   and cut it down to minimize time on the running of my program.  I believe
   that 7500 was small enough to be efficent but also large enough to capture
   the whole dataset.

### Step 1
We added a function get_domains to calculate domains. created tdidt with the help of
a bunch of helper functions. Titanic is all categorical so there was no need to
discretize.

### Step 2
We discretize weight and mpg for the decision tree.

### Step 3
We added a function print_rules that starts the IF and calls a recursive function
print_rules_helper which prints the rest of the rules.

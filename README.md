# Data-Mining-Final-Project
The goal of the project is to develop and evaluation classifiers for a dataset.

## Details
For my project I will be using a dataset corresponding to made and missed 
long shots in the NBA.  Some of the attributes are location (home or 
away), result (win or loss), final margin (number of points won or lost 
by), quarter number, game clock (how much time is left in a quarter), 
shot clock (how much time is left on the shot clock), distance to the 
closest defender, and weather the shot was made or not.  Although the 
dataset has over 100,000 instances, I will have to clean and cut that 
down significantly in my cleaning step. I will be attempting to guess
whether a shot is made or not based on all of the attributes that 
I previously listed.

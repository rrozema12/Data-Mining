# Data-Mining-Final-Project
The goal of the project is to develop and evaluation classifiers for a dataset.

## Details
For my project I will be using a dataset corresponding to whether a particular person makes 
more than 50k a year based on particular qualities.

Some of the attributes that I will be using are:
   - age
   - college degree
   - marital status
   - position in company
   - husband, wife, or not in a family
   - ethnicity
   - gender
   - country of residence
   
Given a new person with the above attribures, I will be guessing whether that person
will make more or less than 50k per year.

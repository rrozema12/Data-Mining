# Data-Mining-Final-Project
The goal of the project is to develop and evaluation classifiers for a dataset.

## Details
For my project I will be using a dataset corresponding to made and missed shots in the NBA. The dataset that I am using has over 100,000 instances so I will have to clean and cut that down significantly in my cleaning step.  To accomplish this, I will use a particular set of shots taken in a year by a random teams.  Similarly, there are many attributes in this data set.  In my cleaning step, I will have to eliminate some of those.  Some of the attributes that I will be using are location of the game (home or away), result of thee game (win or loss), final point differential (number of points won or lost by), quarter number in which the shot was taken, time left on the game clock when the shot was taken, time left on the shot clock when the shot was taken, distance to the closest defender, and whether the shot was made or not.  I will be guessing whether a shot is made or missed given a new instance based on all of the attributes that I previously listed.  In my report, I will perform data visualization (bar graphs with elements binned by shot distance, etc) as well as classifications for Knn, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees.

### Step 1
Created random forest python file with implementation for a random forest
classifier. Also modified tdidt in decision_tree to accept F as a parameter

### Step 2
Ran the random forest classifier on the auto_table dataset and titanic dataset
with N = 20, M = 7, F = 2

### Step 3
Ran the random forest classifier with various N, M, and F values to find the best
set of them. N = 400, M = 300, F = 3.

### Step 4
Ran the random forest classifier over the wisconson.dat datset and found the best
values.
